# Styled Math Notes

A collection of styled blocks and templates for writing clear, structured math notes, lecture writeups, and reading summaries.

## ✨ Features

* Styled environments for common math elements:
* Definitions, theorems, proofs, examples, remarks, and more.
* Custom color schemes to distinguish different block types.
* Flexible templates for building your own math documents.
* Personal reading notes on research papers, written using the same styled framework.

## 📚 Use Cases

* Lecture notes
* Self-study writeups
* Research paper reading notes
* Teaching material preparation

## 📝 Notes

In addition to templates, this repo also includes my notes on the papers I read. These serve as examples of how the styled blocks can be applied in practice.
